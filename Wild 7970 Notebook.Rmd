Week 1: AI Discussion 

Originally I was going to produce a paragraph created by ChatGPT to see what it would formulate on the controversy of AI. However, the program requires you to login and possibly allow access to your information which at the moment makes me uncomfortable. I will delve on it more in the near future if I want to look into it more.

I feel like this introduction paragraph is a good stepping stone on my thoughts on this software. It does terrify me and it honestly hurts my head thinking about this topic with all its scenarios and repercussions. However, like we discussed in class I do think it has pros; for example, I want to write code on calculating the 95% CIs of a glmer, this software may be able to help me answer than question. Regardless this comes down to morals in my opinion, will scientist use this to write paper (very likely), will I use it to write papers (morally I don't feel good doing that). This class really started out with a bang when it comes to topics.
